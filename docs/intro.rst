Introduction
============

``paleontologist`` is a modular python interface which enables the user to organize and analyze the data obtained from Fiji Plugin Mastodon. The purpose of paleontologist is to perform the final step of the image processing steps, which is the analysis of the tracked cells. 

Motivation
**********
Pelontologist is born as a user friendly group of Jupyter Notebooks which allow the user to easily inspect the cell tracks, perform analysis on the time traces (phase analysis, cell division, clustering) and also, on the spatial data from the cells and the embryo or organism which these cells were tracked from. As a result, paleontologist provides a group of figures which are ready to show in a presentation or to add in a publication. It allows very easy edition of the figures so that the outcome can be easil personalized.

Limitations
***********
At the moment, the spatial analysis performed in 3D by paleontologist only suports non-fused data (e.g. data which was acquired only one source of ilumination or that did not have to go through any fusion pre-processing step).
