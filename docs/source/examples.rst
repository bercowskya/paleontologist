Installation and Usage
**********************

The package has not been published in PyPi yet, so you cannot install using pip. This will come soon!

For now, the suggested method is to clone the repository and add your data into the ``Data`` folder. Otherwise, just add `paleo.py`, `mastodon_functions.py` and `paleo_functions.py` in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebooks and call the submodules of interest (e.g. ``from paleo import AllTracks``.
